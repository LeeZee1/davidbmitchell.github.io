          “The master-economist must possess a rare combination of gifts .... He must be mathematician, historian,
          statesman, philosopher -- in some degree. He must understand symbols and speak in words. He must contemplate
          the particular, in terms of the general, and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He
          must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of man's nature or
          his institutions must be entirely outside his regard. He must be purposeful and disinterested in a simultaneous
          mood, as aloof and incorruptible as an artist, yet sometimes as near to earth as a politician.”
          <cite>Lord John Maynard Keynes</cite>
